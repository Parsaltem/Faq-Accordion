## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### Thoughts

This was the my first project using JS. I tried to keep it simple to read. First I created JS head and text objects within an data array. Then create HTML document. I did really enjoy while creating all documents. I hope you do too.

I may update this solution in the future, until then, this element is an interesting thing to note, at least.
